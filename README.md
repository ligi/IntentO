IntentO ( Intent Opportunities )
================================

When android asks you which App to use for a certain action and you missed options between "always" and "just once" - this app might be for you.
Intercepts Intents and will offer a rule-system to determine which follow-up intent will be started.

Things you can do with it:
 - Select launcher depending on different times of the day
 - Use a specific map application depending on network status
 - Start a different launcher after panic event
 - ..
